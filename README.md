## Synopsis

A lightweight timeseries object for python 2.7+ and Python 3+

## Usage

__Python3__
`import tslite3`

__Python 2.7+__
`import tslite`

##Example:

TODO: Write API and example documentation.

## Motivation

This effort evolved out of a project that ran on a server with draconian security which made it difficult to install dependenices for python libraries. Also, I wasn't happy with the state of timeseries libraries in python circa 2010. I still maintain this package, and it does some things that other timeseries computation and manipulation librares don't do. 

## Installation

Download and place in the same directory as your project.
